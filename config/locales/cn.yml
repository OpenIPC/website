        paragraph1: Please enter the camera configuration in the provided form and press the "Generate Installation Guide" button. On the next page, you will find the binary files and the commands you have to execute for the installation of the OpenIPC firmware on the camera.
        paragraph2: Do not overlook this part. You may think that it is not necessary since you are not going to return to the dark past, but we assure you that the stock firmware will still be needed for restoring missing settings, drivers, and further research.

    installation:
      backup:
        info: OpenIPC U-Boot overwrites the original crypto partition making it impossible to revert to the factory firmware unless you have a full flash backup for this particular camera! To create a full firmware backup start a TFTP server and run these commands in bootloader shell.

          Please refer to <a href="https://github.com/openipc/wiki/blob/master/en/installation.md">Installation
          instructions</a> in the project's wiki for more information.

      backup_32: ATTENTION! Before backing up 32M flash ROM, make sure that the camera has at least 64M of RAM.
      flashing:
        alternative: Alternatively, flash OpenIPC Firmware by its parts

          The camera will automatically restart to apply changes.
          Stay focused and prepare to interrupt the booting sequence in order to get back into the bootloader shell.
        info: When in the bootloader shell, remap ROM partitioning according to your flash size and type.
        title: Prepare the camera for OpenIPC Linux
      flashing_footfs2:
        info: Download firmware bundle and unpack it into the root directory of your TFTP server.

      flashing_full:
        continue: |
          The camera will automatically restart and boot with the brand new bootloader.
          Stay focused and prepare to interrupt the booting sequence in order to get back into the bootloader shell.
        continue2: When in the bootloader shell, remap ROM partitioning according to your flash size and type.
        info: |
          The full firmware image consists of bootloader, kernel and root filesystem, and is also suitable for flashing
          memory chip using a programmer. Please note, the full image does not contain pre-set environment. You still
          need to add your own MAC address, IP address and other settings.
