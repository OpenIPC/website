      paragraph1: OpenIPC is an open source operating system from the open community targeting for IP cameras with ARM and MIPS processors from several manufacturers in order to replace that closed, opaque, insecure, often abandoned and unsupported firmware pre-installed by a vendor.
      paragraph2_html: OpenIPC Firmware comes as binary pre-compiled files for easy installation by end-user. Also, we provide full access to the source files for further development and improvement by any capable programmer willing to contribute to the project. OpenIPC source code is released under one of the most simple open source license agreements, <a href="https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT">MIT License</a>, giving users express permission to reuse code for any purpose, even as part of a proprietary software. We only ask you politely to contribute your improvements back to us and also be sure to contact us if you use our project for <a href="/support-open-source">commercial purposes</a>. We would be grateful for any feedback and suggestions.
      paragraph3_html: OpenIPC Firmware uses <a href="https://buildroot.org/">Buildroot</a> to build its Linux distro, and utilizes either <a href="https://github.com/OpenIPC/majestic">Majestic</a>, <a href="https://github.com/OpenIPC/divinus">Divinus</a>, <a href="https://github.com/OpenIPC/mini">Mini</a> or <a href="https://github.com/OpenIPC/silicon_research">Venc</a> streamer.
      paragraph4_html: Majestic code while is not open, provides unprecedented performance and capabilities for a wide range of hardware. The author of Majestic streamer is looking into possibilities to open-source the codebase after he secures enough funds to support further open development. You can <a href="/support-open-source">help</a> to make it happen sooner.
      paragraph5: First of all, OpenIPC Firmware brings you freedom. With OpenIPC on your camera you are the master of your streams. You have full access to the system and can control what, where, and how you want your camera to behave. There are no backdoors, no botnets, no crypto-mining malware, no keyloggers, no password sniffers, nothing you could possibly expect in a closed binary system with no access to its source code.
      paragraph6: As for the Firmware capabilities, we strive to provide universal support for a wide range of cameras, thus we are focused on basic functionality first, allowing end-users to upgrade their cameras' firmware and stream video and audio (where supported) without too much hassle.
      paragraph7: We have some interesting bits though. Our Firmware supports external IPEYE cloud storage, streaming video to Youtube and Telegram, using SOCKS5 proxy, setting up a Virtual Tunnel, and more.
      paragraph8: There are also several projects focused on specialized equipment, such as a camera to be mounted on a drone, for mounting on construction helmets, for use in surveying tools, for medical research of the organs of vision, underwater fishing, etc.

    stages_of_firmware_development:
      done_alt: 'Image: stage DONE'
      done_info: Done and done! Bootloader boots, Linux loads, streamer can stream video and produce snaphots. You can have yourself a working platform open for tinkering and further improvements. We still expect feedback and patches from you guys, though.
      hlp_alt: 'Image: stage HLP'
      hlp_info: Help wanted. We have the hardware, we have the SDK, the basic stuff is learned and done. But we are stuck. This is where we are looking for help from experienced embedded developers to overcome the obstacles and move on to the next stage.
      mvp_alt: 'Image: stage MVP'
      mvp_info: A minimal viable product. The basic system is built, the platform can produce video, at least on the main channel, but due to a lack of human resources, development is delayed or halted. A financial infusion could push the development to the final stage.
      neq_alt: 'Image: stage NEQ'
      neq_info_html: No Equipment. We have an SDK for the platform, but we don't have specific hardware to continue development, you can donate it to our R&D guys (especially old boards that passed <abbr title="End-Of-Life">EOL</abbr> and can not longer be bought).
      paragraph1: After we acquire an SDK for a new SoC, we add the SoC to the table of supported hardware. We assign either NEQ (No Equipment) status, if we do not have particular hardware modules, or HLP (Help Needed) status, if we have the hardware but are looking for a developer who would lead the development for that SoC. This is considered an official start of development.
      paragraph2: There is no reason to have SoC in the table without having its SDK.
      paragraph3: As work on the SoC progresses, its status changes, gradually. First to RND, then to WIP, then further to MVP, and, finally, to DONE.
      rnd_alt: 'Image: stage R&D'
      rnd_info: The Research and Development stage, when we already have the platform SDK and maybe even the hardware boards, but we are starting to fiddle with the platform, studying its specifics and features. There is still a lot of work ahead.
      subtitle: Typical development lifecycle
      title: Stages of Firmware development
      wip_alt: 'Image: stage WIP'
      wip_info: Work in progress. We learned a lot about the platform hardware and code base, prepared the first public binary build, and are waiting for the first adopters to test it on their boards and provide feedback to help us move forward.
