      run <code>printenv</code> in bootloader console.
    installation:
      backup:
        info: OpenIPC U-Boot overwrites the original crypto partition making it impossible to revert to the factory firmware unless you have a full flash backup for this particular camera! To create a full firmware backup start a TFTP server and run these commands in bootloader shell.

          Please refer to <a href="https://github.com/openipc/wiki/blob/master/en/installation.md">Installation
          instructions</a> in the project's wiki for more information.
        subtitle: Back up your stock firmware, don't skip this part of the installation process!
        title: Save the original firmware
      backup_32: ATTENTION! Before backing up 32M flash ROM, make sure that the camera has at least 64M of RAM.
      flashing:
        alternative: Alternatively, flash OpenIPC Firmware by its parts
      flashing_footfs:
        continue: |
          The camera will automatically restart to apply changes.
          Stay focused and prepare to interrupt the booting sequence in order to get back into the bootloader shell.
        info: When in the bootloader shell, remap ROM partitioning according to your flash size and type.
        title: Prepare the camera for OpenIPC Linux
      flashing_footfs2:
        info: Download firmware bundle and unpack it into the root directory of your TFTP server.
        link: Download OpenIPC Firmware (%{name}) bundle
        title: Flash OpenIPC Linux kernel and root filesystem
      flashing_full:
        continue: |
          The camera will automatically restart and boot with the brand new bootloader.
          Stay focused and prepare to interrupt the booting sequence in order to get back into the bootloader shell.
        continue2: When in the bootloader shell, remap ROM partitioning according to your flash size and type.
        info: |
          The full firmware image consists of bootloader, kernel and root filesystem, and is also suitable for flashing
          memory chip using a programmer.

      flashing_uboot:
        continue: |
          The camera will boot into the newly flashed bootloader.
          Stay focused and prepare to interrupt the booting sequence in order to get back into the bootloader shell.
        info: Download bootloader binary file and save it to the root directory of your TFTP server.
