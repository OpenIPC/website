      <h3 class="mb-4">OpenIPC is an alternative open firmware for your IP camera.</h3>
      <p>OpenIPC is an open-source operating system targeting IP cameras with ARM and MIPS processors from several
        manufacturers in order to replace that closed, opaque, insecure, often abandoned and unsupported firmware
        pre-installed by a vendor.</p>
      <p>OpenIPC Firmware comes as binary pre-compiled files for easy installation by end-user. Also, we provide full
        access to the source files for further development and improvement by any capable programmer willing to
        contribute to the project. OpenIPC source code is released under one of the most simple open source license
        agreements, <a href="https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT">MIT License</a>, giving users express permission to
        reuse code for any purpose, even as part of a proprietary software. We only ask you politely to contribute your
        improvements back to us. We would be grateful for any feedback and suggestions.</p>

      <p>OpenIPC Firmware uses <a href="https://buildroot.org/">Buildroot</a> to build its Linux distro, and
        utilizes either <a href="https://github.com/OpenIPC/majestic">Majestic</a>, <a href="https://github.com/OpenIPC/mini">Mini</a>
        or <a href="https://github.com/OpenIPC/silicon_research">Venc</a> streamer.</p>
      <p class="small text-muted">Majestic code while is not open, provides unprecedented performance and capabilities
        for a wide range of hardware. The author of Majestic streamer is looking into possibilities to open-source the
        codebase after he secures enough funds to support further open development.
        You can <a href="/support-open-source">help</a> to make it happen sooner.</p>

      <h3 class="mb-4">Why OpenIPC Firmware?</h3>
      <p>First of all, OpenIPC Firmware brings you freedom. With OpenIPC on your camera you are the master of your
        streams. You have full access to the system and can control what, where, and how you want your camera to behave.
        There are no backdoors, no botnets, no crypto-mining malware, no keyloggers, no password sniffers, nothing you
        could possibly expect in a closed binary system with no access to its source code.</p>
      <p>As for the Firmware capabilities, we strive to provide universal support for a wide range of cameras, thus we
        are focused on basic functionality first, allowing end-users to upgrade their cameras' firmware and stream video
        and audio (where supported) without too much hassle.</p>
      <p>We have some interesting bits though. Our Firmware supports IPEYE cloud storage, streaming video to Youtube and
        Telegram, using SOCKS5 proxy, setting up a Virtual Tunnel, and more.</p>
      <p>There are also several projects focused on specialized equipment, such as a camera to be mounted on a drone,
        for mounting on construction helmets, for use in surveying tools, for medical research of the organs of vision,
        underwater fishing, etc.</p>
